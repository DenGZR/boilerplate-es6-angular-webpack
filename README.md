# Boilerplate Es6 Angular Webpack

This is a starter kit to get you working with es6 classes and modules within Angular using Webpack.

Basic Setup

1. run `git clone https://github.com/nearbycoder/boilerplate-es6-angular-webpack.git`
2. run `npm install` within the directory the repo is located
3. run 'npm start' this will start webpack-dev-server on port 8080
4. From there the root of the app is `/src/app/app.js`

Take note: I have created a example component called home. This wil show you how to use es6 imports with angular to create a folder module structure for your components.
